# Instructions for Adding Your Profile Picture

To display your profile picture on the portfolio website:

1. **Prepare your image:**
   - Use a professional headshot or portrait photo
   - Recommended size: at least 800x800 pixels
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP

2. **Add the image:**
   - Place your image file in the `public/assets/` folder
   - Name it `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png` if PNG format)

3. **File path:**
   - The image should be located at: `public/assets/profile.jpg`

4. **Fallback:**
   - If no image is found, the website will display your initials "SJ" on a gradient background

**Note:** The `public` folder is already created. Just add an `assets` subfolder and place your profile picture there.
